# Part IX: Operations

The final part covers **building and releasing** Whis.

## What You'll Learn

Operational aspects of the project:

- **Chapter 27: Build System** - Cargo workspace, cross-compilation, Tauri bundling
- **Chapter 28: CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions workflow, multi-platform releases

## Why Operations Matter

Even as a developer, understanding the build system helps you:

1. **Debug build issues** - Feature flags, platform-specific compilation
2. **Test locally** - Cross-compile for different targets
3. **Contribute** - Know how changes affect releases

```admonish tip
This part is shorter and more reference-oriented. Skim it first, then return when you need specific build information.
```

## What We Cover

- **Workspace configuration** - Shared dependencies and feature propagation
- **Platform targets** - Linux, macOS, Windows, Android
- **Release process** - Automated builds, artifact naming, publishing

## Time Estimate

- **Quick read**: ~20 minutes
- **Thorough read**: ~45 minutes
