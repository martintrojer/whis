//! User interface and recording settings.
//!
//! This module contains settings for:
//! - Audio recording configuration (microphone, VAD, chunking)
//! - Output handling (clipboard backend, presets)
//! - Desktop-specific features (floating bubble overlay)
//!
//! Note: Keyboard shortcuts are now in the `shortcuts` module.
